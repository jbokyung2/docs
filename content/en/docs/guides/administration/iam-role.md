    **Role** is a unit that defines the scope of privileges.
---

An administrator can create desired roles and assign them to [Users](/docs/guides/administration/iam-user/) who will perform such roles.

The properties set up for a role are as follows:

#### Role type

| | Project management privilege | the position to grant roles to users |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | • Create your own <br/>• Invited projects and project groups<br/>• Subprojects within the project groups you have privilege to enter | • Invite other users to the project under the project detail page > [Members] tab<br/>• When changing member information, you can shift the type of user’s role |
| **Admin** | All projects and project groups | Add or edit users on the [Admin > Users and permission management > Users] page |

#### Access permission for each page of the Cloudforet service

You can grant different `view` and `manage` permissions for each sub menu of each service.

- **View**

  View permissions are separately given for each page.

- **Manage**

  You can use management features such as create, edit, add, etc. that exist in a selected service menu. (Management features are different for each service/page.)


#### Reviewing API policy

Policy is an object that defines privilege over a resource when it is attached.

For guidelines on policies, see [Policy documents](/docs/guides/administration/iam-policy).
